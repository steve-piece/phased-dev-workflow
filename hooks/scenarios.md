# Hook Scenario Contract

This file is the **canonical source of truth** for hook behavior. Every row is one scenario the hook scripts handle. Both the scripts in this directory and the per-skill `## Preconditions` sections of every SKILL.md reference this table. If a scenario is missing here but enforced in code, that's drift — fix the table or the code, not both independently.

`hooks/test.sh` reads this file and runs every row against the live hook scripts. A failing test means the implementation and the contract have diverged.

## Legend

- **BLOCK** — hook exits 2; Claude Code prevents the action and shows the message
- **WARN** — hook exits 0 and prints to stdout; Claude sees the warning as additional context but proceeds
- **PASS** — hook exits 0 with no output; nothing surfaces to Claude
- **CONTEXT** — hook exits 0 and prints to stdout; used for SessionStart context injection

## UserPromptSubmit: `precheck-skill.sh`

| Skill in prompt | Project state | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `/sell-slice` | no `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` | **BLOCK** — "requires master checklist, run /cook-pizzas first" |
| `/sell-slice` | checklist exists, all Prep `[x]`, clean tree | **PASS** |
| `/sell-slice` | checklist exists, some Prep `[ ]` | **WARN** — "Prep section incomplete: N/M boxes checked" |
| `/sell-slice` | checklist exists, Prep uses legacy bare `[ ]` boxes (pre-5.1.3 output), all checked | **PASS**: canonical dashed `- [ ]` and legacy bare `[ ]` boxes are both counted |
| `/sell-slice` | checklist exists, Prep mixes dashed `- [x]` and bare `[ ]` boxes | **WARN** with both forms counted in the N/M totals |
| `/sell-slice` | checklist exists, dirty git tree | **WARN** — "working tree is dirty" |
| `/box-it-up` | current branch is `main` or `master` | **BLOCK** — "refuses to run on main/master" |
| `/box-it-up` | feature branch, no `gh auth` | **WARN** — "gh CLI not authenticated" |
| `/box-it-up` | feature branch, `gh` authed | **PASS** |
| `/cook-pizzas` | no checklist | **PASS** — cook-pizzas is allowed to run without one (it produces the checklist) |
| `/special-order` | no checklist | **BLOCK** — "requires master checklist" |
| `/run-the-day` | no checklist | **BLOCK** |
| `/close-shop` | no checklist | **BLOCK** |
| no bytheslice command | any | **PASS** |
| any bytheslice command | `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` set | **PASS** — env var short-circuits all hooks |

## PreToolUse on Bash: `pre-commit-guard.sh`

| Bash command | Branch | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `git commit -m "..."` | `main` or `master` | **BLOCK** — "refusing git commit on main/master" |
| `git commit -m "..."` | feature branch | **WARN** — staged file list |
| `git status` | any | **PASS** (not a git commit) |
| `npm test` | any | **PASS** |
| any command | `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | **PASS** |

## SessionStart: `shop-status.sh`

| Project state | Expected |
|---|---|
| no `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` | **PASS** — silent (not a bytheslice project) |
| checklist present | **CONTEXT** — stage counts, Prep progress, next not-started row |
| checklist present, nested v5 (`## Pie N` headings) | **CONTEXT**: Prep progress, pie and slice counts via the dual-read lib helpers (`bts_unit_counts` / `bts_slice_counts`), first open pie |
| checklist present, flat v4 (`Status:` table rows) | **CONTEXT**: Prep progress (if a `## Prep` section exists), stage counts from the `Status:` scan, next not-started row |
| `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | **PASS** — silent |

## PreToolUse on Write/Edit: `stage-plan-guard.sh`

| Tool target | Session state | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/plans/stage_1_foo.md` | current session, `skill == "sell-slice"` | **WARN** — "plans are normally static" (downgraded from BLOCK in v5, C4) |
| `docs/plans/stage_1_foo.md` | current session, `skill != "sell-slice"` | **PASS** |
| `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` | current session, `skill == "sell-slice"` | **PASS** — not a `stage_*` plan file |
| `src/app/page.tsx` (non-plan path) | current session, `skill == "sell-slice"` | **PASS** |
| `docs/plans/stage_1_foo.md` | state from a *different* `session_id` | **PASS** — stale state never blocks |
| `docs/plans/stage_1_foo.md` | no `last-precheck.json` | **PASS** — fail open |
| any stage plan path | `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | **PASS** |

## PreToolUse on Write/Edit: `library-gate-guard.sh`

| Tool target | State | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (watched) | no `library-approvals.json` | **PASS**, gate not armed (Phase 4.5's `arm` step has not run, e.g. a backend slice) |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (watched) | approvals file present, no approval entry, current-session `skill == "sell-slice"` | **WARN** — "no library approval is recorded" |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (watched) | approvals file present, an approval recorded, `skill == "sell-slice"` | **PASS** |
| `lib/util.ts` (not watched) | approvals file present, no approval, `skill == "sell-slice"` | **PASS** — path not under a watched glob |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (watched) | approvals present, no approval, `skill != "sell-slice"` | **PASS** |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (watched) | approvals present, state from a *different* `session_id` | **PASS** — stale state never warns |
| any watched path | `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | **PASS** |

## State writer: `record-library-approval.sh`

Not an event hook: `/sell-slice` Phase 4.5 invokes it directly. `arm` opens the approval window (the gate above starts warning); `approve` closes it (the gate passes). Session id defaults to the one in `last-precheck.json`, the exact value the gate compares against.

| Invocation | Prior state | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `arm --slice <n.m>` | file present or not | file written: zero approvals, default `watched_paths`, session id + slice + `armed_at`; gate now **WARN**s on watched paths |
| `arm --slice <n.m>` | approvals recorded for a prior slice | file reset: approvals emptied, slice and `armed_at` updated; gate **WARN**s again |
| `approve --slice <n.m> --components "<a>,<b>"` | file armed | one `status: "approved"` entry appended per component (`component_id`, `at`, `session_id`, `slice`); gate **PASS**es on watched paths |
| `approve --slice <n.m> --components "<a>"` | no file (arm skipped) | file initialized with the approved entries; gate **PASS**es |
| `approve` without `--components`, or either subcommand without `--slice` | any | usage error, exit 2, nothing written |
| any subcommand | `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | no-op, exit 0, nothing written |

## PreCompact: `compact-snapshot.sh`

| State | Expected |
|---|---|
| `last-precheck.json` present | **PASS** (exit 0, silent) — writes `compact-snapshot.json` with skill carried over |
| no `last-precheck.json` | **PASS** (exit 0, silent) — still writes a minimal `compact-snapshot.json` |
| checklist present with unfinished lines | snapshot's `master_checklist_summary` holds up to 3 of them |
| `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` | **PASS** — no snapshot written |

## Notes

- Every hook honors `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` as the first action after `set -u`. That's the supported per-session disable.
- Every hook tolerates missing `jq` — JSON parsing falls back to `sed`.
- All state lives under `.claude/.bytheslice-state/` (gitignored).
- All awk in the hooks is POSIX-portable (BSD awk on macOS has no gawk extensions such as the 3-argument `match()`).
