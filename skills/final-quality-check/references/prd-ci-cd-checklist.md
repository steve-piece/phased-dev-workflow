# PRD CI/CD Checklist (Required)

These rules govern how master-checklist updates, CI gates, and PR shape interact across every ByTheSlice run. The orchestrator surfaces these as guardrails to every stage skill that touches CI workflows or the master checklist; final-quality-check itself enforces them when scaffolding the baseline.

- [ ] Before any phased-plan integration run, update `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` with current stage status and exact in-scope checklist items.

- [ ] After any phased-plan integration run, immediately update `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` with completion status, notes, and verification outcomes.

- [ ] CI must gate merges on: lint, typecheck, unit/integration tests, `@feature` E2E, `@regression-core` E2E, `@visual` E2E, design-system-compliance, and (if applicable) db-schema-drift.

- [ ] Do not mark checklist items complete until all required local and CI gates are green for that slice.

- [ ] Expand CI/E2E coverage when shared routes, components, schemas, or APIs are modified; include both changed-flow and regression-core tests.

- [ ] Preserve deterministic pipelines: pinned runtime/package manager, reproducible install command, and explicit test commands in workflow steps.

- [ ] Upload failure artifacts (trace/video/report/logs) for all E2E failures and treat missing artifacts as a failed run.

- [ ] Any CI/CD extension must keep required checks aligned with local pre-push gates and documented in repository workflow files.

- [ ] Keep one scoped checklist slice per PR whenever possible; avoid bundling unrelated stage tasks in one delivery.

- [ ] If stage file instructions conflict with checklist status, stop and clarify scope before implementation.

- [ ] Never wire shadscan into a gate: no `--fail-under` in `.husky/pre-push`, no shadscan step in any CI workflow, no shadscan check in branch protection, and never run `shadscan setup` (its only effect is writing pre-commit hooks). The score is heavily penalized by deliberate architecture choices (not using shadcn, dark-theme-only with no theme toggle, no command menu) and by a false-positive rate around one in three, so gating on it would block correct work.

- [ ] Never run shadscan `--apply`. It launches a coding agent against unfiltered findings, which at this false-positive rate would produce wrong changes.

- [ ] Treat every shadscan finding as a lead to verify against source, never as fact. Discard any finding whose file path is inside the operator-only `/library` showcase route before acting on it: those entries are mockups by design, and shadscan has no ignore, exclude, or rule-waiver mechanism, so it scans and scores them as production code.

## shadscan false-positive classes (confirmed)

Three failure modes are confirmed and reproducible. When a finding matches one of these, the burden of proof is on the finding, not on the code.

**Dependency sniffing.** The rule's real pass condition is a `package.json` lookup. It fails "toast provider present" when `sonner` or Radix Toast is absent from dependencies, even with a working hand-rolled provider mounted in the app shell. Its own evidence admitted the provider was mounted, then failed the rule anyway.

**Named-helper indirection.** It cannot follow a guard extracted into a named function. It reported a missing typing-target guard on a global hotkey when that exact guard existed as an `isTypingTarget()` helper called one line above.

**Unresolved components.** When it cannot resolve a custom component it gives up and reports failure. It failed "async action pending state" on a component using `useTransition` and `disabled={pending}`, with evidence literally reading "could not be resolved".

Evidence that contradicts its own verdict is the strongest tell. Read the cited file before changing anything.
