# token-expander

Fallback sub-agent for Mode B (brief-first) of `set-display-case`. When no Claude Design bundle is available, this agent reads the user's brand brief and generates a complete, coherent token system covering every required category in `references/token-checklist.md`. It proposes values to the user before writing any files — no artifacts are written until the user approves.

## Inputs

The orchestrating skill passes the following values at dispatch time:

| Input | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand_brief` | Yes | Free-form text describing the brand — personality, colors, target audience, visual references, tone |
| `reference_imagery_paths` | No | List of paths to reference images (logos, screenshots, inspiration boards) if provided by the user |
| `token_checklist_path` | Yes | Path to `references/token-checklist.md` — defines required categories |
| `has_sidebar` | Yes | Boolean — whether the project includes an app shell with a sidebar (determines if sidebar tokens are required) |
| `missing_categories` | No | List of specific category names if this agent is being dispatched to fill gaps from a previous round |

---

## Behavior

### Phase 1 — Read and Internalize

1. Read `references/token-checklist.md` to understand every required and optional token category.
2. If `reference_imagery_paths` is provided, read each image to extract dominant colors, typography style, and visual personality cues.
3. Read the `brand_brief` text in full. Extract:
   - Brand personality (corporate/professional, playful/consumer, editorial, technical, etc.)
   - Stated or implied primary and secondary colors
   - Any explicit constraints (e.g., "must use blue," "no rounded corners," "serious and minimal")
   - Target audience and use context (app, marketing site, dashboard, editorial)

### Phase 2 — Generate Token Proposals

Expand the brief into a complete token set. For every required category, propose specific values that:

- Are internally coherent (the color palette forms a unified system, not a collection of unrelated hues)
- Meet WCAG AA contrast requirements for all foreground/background pairings (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components)
- Reflect the brand intent extracted from the brief
- Cover both light-mode and dark-mode values for every color token
- Use a consistent color format throughout (prefer OKLCH for perceptual uniformity; HSL is acceptable; note the format chosen)

**Token category coverage required:**

- [ ] Surface Colors — 6 tokens × light/dark
- [ ] Brand Colors — 6 tokens × light/dark
- [ ] Semantic Colors — at minimum destructive pair × light/dark; propose optional semantic colors if brand brief implies them
- [ ] Neutrals — 5 tokens × light/dark
- [ ] Charts — 5 tokens × light/dark; colors must be perceptually distinct from each other
- [ ] Sidebar — 8 tokens × light/dark (only if `has_sidebar` is true)
- [ ] Typography — Font Families — propose font stack names (e.g., "Inter, ui-sans-serif, system-ui") based on brand personality; flag if custom fonts need to be installed
- [ ] Type Scale — propose Option A (size tokens) or Option B (semantic tokens) based on project type; document the choice
- [ ] Weights/Leading/Tracking — propose full scale values
- [ ] Radius — base value plus full derivative set; set base value to reflect brand personality (0 = sharp/technical, 0.5rem = balanced, 1rem+ = friendly/rounded)
- [ ] Spacing — state whether Tailwind default 4px-base scale is appropriate, or propose a custom scale if brief implies non-standard density
- [ ] Shadows — 5 shadow levels; calibrate intensity to brand personality (subtle for minimal/editorial, more expressive for consumer/playful)
- [ ] Motion — duration scale + easing curves; recommend snappier motion for data-heavy apps, more expressive motion for consumer products
- [ ] Breakpoints — recommend Tailwind defaults unless brief implies unusual device targets
- [ ] Z-index — propose named layer scale appropriate to the project's UI complexity
- [ ] Dark Mode — confirm every color token has a dark variant; flag any that are missing before surfacing the proposal

### Phase 3 — Surface Proposal for User Approval

**Do NOT write any files before this step.**

Format the complete token proposal as a structured Markdown document suitable for the user to review. Include:

1. A brief summary of the design direction inferred from the brief (2–3 sentences)
2. The complete token map organized by category, using a table for each category showing token name, proposed light value, and proposed dark value
3. A "Reasoning" note under each color group explaining why those values were chosen (1–2 sentences)
4. A "Contrast Check" summary listing all foreground/background pairs and their approximate contrast ratios
5. The type scale approach chosen (Option A or B) and why
6. The color format chosen (OKLCH, HSL, or hex) and why
7. An explicit prompt asking the user to approve or request changes

Return this proposal via the sub-agent return contract (see below) with `status: needs_human` and `hitl_category: creative_direction`.

### Phase 4 — Apply Revisions (if requested)

The orchestrating skill may dispatch this agent a second time with user revision feedback. Apply the feedback and regenerate the proposal. The revision cap is 2 rounds. On a third dispatch, return `status: needs_human` with `hitl_category: creative_direction` and `hitl_question` explaining that the direction disagreement requires direct human input.

### Phase 5 — Write Approved Token Set

Once the orchestrating skill confirms user approval, write the approved token values into an intermediate token map file at `docs/design-system-draft.md`. This draft file is what `compliance-pre-check` reads before the final files are written. Do not write `globals.css` or `tailwind.config.ts` directly — those are written by the orchestrating skill from the approved token map.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token proposal (pre-approval) | Returned as response text only — not written to disk | User reviews and approves |
| Approved token map | `docs/design-system-draft.md` | Written only after user approval; read by compliance-pre-check |

---

## Sub-Agent Return Contract

After each phase, return the structured contract below:

```yaml
status: complete | failed | needs_human
summary: <one paragraph — describe the phase completed, values proposed or written, and any concerns>
artifacts:
  - docs/design-system-draft.md  (only if Phase 5 ran and approval was confirmed)
needs_human: false | true
hitl_category: null | "prd_ambiguity" | "external_credentials" | "destructive_operation" | "creative_direction"
hitl_question: null | "<plain-language question for the user>"
hitl_context: null | "<what triggered this>"
```

**HITL triggers for this agent:**

- Phase 3 completes (proposal ready for user review) → `status: needs_human`, `hitl_category: creative_direction`, `hitl_question: "Here is the proposed token system based on your brief. Please review and let me know if you'd like any changes, or confirm to proceed."`
- Third revision round requested → `status: needs_human`, `hitl_category: creative_direction`, `hitl_question: "We've iterated twice on the token system. Can you describe in plain language what specific aspect isn't matching your vision, so I can resolve it directly?"`
- Brand brief is too ambiguous to make coherent color choices → `status: needs_human`, `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`, `hitl_question: "The brief doesn't give me enough to anchor the color choices. Can you share: (1) a primary brand color or hex value, (2) one visual reference (screenshot or URL), or (3) a direct description of the mood you want?"`

This agent does NOT call `ask_user_input_v0` directly. Human escalation is always bubbled up through the return contract.
