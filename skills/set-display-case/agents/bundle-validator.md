# bundle-validator

Read-only sub-agent that validates a Claude Design bundle before any token files are written to the target project. This agent never writes, edits, or deletes files. Its sole output is a structured validation report.

---

## Inputs

The orchestrating skill passes the following values to this agent at dispatch time:

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bundle_path` | Absolute or project-relative path to the Claude Design export folder |
| `token_checklist_path` | Path to `references/token-checklist.md` — the canonical gate definition |

**Reference bundle shape:** `https://github.com/steve-piece/Modern-Refactor-Design-System`

---

## Expected Bundle Folder Shape

A valid Claude Design export contains at minimum:

```
<bundle-folder>/
  ├── globals.css          (or variables.css / tokens.css)
  ├── tailwind.config.ts   (or tailwind.config.js)
  └── design-system.md     (or design-tokens.md / README.md)
```

Additional files that may be present (treat as supplementary, not required):

```
  ├── tokens.json          (design token JSON — useful for cross-referencing)
  ├── theme.json           (shadcn theme export)
  ├── components/          (optional component previews)
  └── assets/              (fonts, icons, imagery)
```

The agent must locate the CSS variables file, the Tailwind config, and a readable token reference document. If any of the three primary files are absent, that is a structural failure.

---

## Validation Steps

### Step 1 — Structural Check

- [ ] Bundle folder exists at `bundle_path`
- [ ] A CSS variables file is present (search for files matching `*.css` containing `:root {`)
- [ ] A Tailwind config file is present (search for `tailwind.config.ts` or `tailwind.config.js`)
- [ ] A token reference document is present (any `.md` file in the bundle root or docs subdirectory)

If any structural check fails: set `status: failed`, list the missing files, and return immediately. Do not proceed to token checks.

### Step 2 — Token Completeness Check

Read the CSS variables file. For each required token category in `token-checklist.md`, verify:

- [ ] **Surface Colors** — all 6 required tokens present in `:root`
- [ ] **Brand Colors** — all 6 required tokens present in `:root`
- [ ] **Semantic Colors** — `--destructive` and `--destructive-foreground` present; note which optional tokens are present
- [ ] **Neutrals** — all 5 required tokens present
- [ ] **Charts** — at minimum `--chart-1` through `--chart-5` present
- [ ] **Sidebar** — if a sidebar layout is indicated by context, all 8 sidebar tokens present; if no sidebar, mark as N/A
- [ ] **Typography — Font Families** — `--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono` present
- [ ] **Type Scale** — at least one full scale (Option A or Option B) is present and documented; approach is identified
- [ ] **Weights/Leading/Tracking** — documented in the token reference document (does not require CSS custom properties)
- [ ] **Radius** — `--radius` base plus at minimum `-sm/-md/-lg/-xl/-pill/-full` variants
- [ ] **Spacing** — decision documented (Tailwind default acceptable if stated)
- [ ] **Shadows** — `--shadow-sm` through `--shadow-2xl` present
- [ ] **Motion** — either duration/easing CSS custom properties present, or motion section in reference document
- [ ] **Breakpoints** — documented in reference document (Tailwind defaults acceptable if stated)
- [ ] **Z-index** — named layers documented in reference document
- [ ] **Dark Mode** — `.dark` block (or equivalent) present in the CSS file with overrides for every color token in `:root`

### Step 3 — Dark Mode Parity Check

Compare every color token defined in `:root` against the tokens defined in `.dark` (or `[data-theme="dark"]`):

- [ ] Every `:root` color token has a corresponding dark-mode override
- [ ] No dark-mode token exists without a matching `:root` definition (orphaned dark tokens are a warning, not a failure)

### Step 4 — Canonicalize File Paths

Record the resolved absolute paths for each file that was found, so the orchestrating skill can reference them when writing output artifacts:

- CSS variables file path
- Tailwind config path
- Token reference document path
- Any supplementary files (tokens.json, theme.json) if present

---

## Output

Return a validation report in the following structure. Do not write this to disk — return it as the agent's response text.

```
## Bundle Validation Report

bundle_path: <absolute path to bundle folder>
css_variables_file: <resolved path or "not found">
tailwind_config_file: <resolved path or "not found">
token_reference_file: <resolved path or "not found">

### Structural Check
status: pass | fail
missing_files: [<list of missing files, or empty if pass>]

### Token Completeness
status: pass | fail | partial
missing_categories: [<list of failed category names, or empty if pass>]
missing_tokens: [<list of specific missing token names, e.g. "--chart-3", or empty if pass>]
optional_tokens_present: [<list of optional tokens found>]

### Dark Mode Parity
status: pass | fail
tokens_missing_dark_override: [<list of token names without dark variant, or empty if pass>]
orphaned_dark_tokens: [<list of dark-only tokens with no :root definition, or empty>]

### Canonicalized Paths
css_variables_file: <absolute path>
tailwind_config_file: <absolute path>
token_reference_file: <absolute path>
supplementary_files: [<list of additional found files>]
```

## Sub-Agent Return Contract

After generating the validation report, return the structured contract below so the orchestrating skill can route correctly:

```yaml
status: complete | failed | needs_human
summary: <one paragraph — describe what was validated, what passed, what failed, and any gaps found>
artifacts: []
needs_human: false | true
hitl_category: null | "prd_ambiguity" | "external_credentials" | "destructive_operation" | "creative_direction"
hitl_question: null | "<plain-language question if needs_human is true>"
hitl_context: null | "<what triggered the human escalation>"
```

**HITL triggers for this agent:**

- Bundle folder path does not exist and cannot be located by searching the project → `needs_human: true`, `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`, `hitl_question: "The bundle path provided doesn't exist. Can you confirm the correct path to the Claude Design export?"`
- Structural check fails (missing primary files) → `status: failed`, `needs_human: true`, `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`
- Token completeness fails → `status: failed`, `needs_human: false` (the orchestrating skill handles missing-token prompting)

This agent does NOT call `ask_user_input_v0` directly. Human escalation is always bubbled up through the return contract.
