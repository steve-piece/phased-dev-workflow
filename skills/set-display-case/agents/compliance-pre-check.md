# compliance-pre-check

Read-only sub-agent that verifies token completeness after token files are written (or a draft token map is produced). This agent never writes, edits, or deletes files. It is the final gate before `set-display-case` marks Stage 1 complete.

This agent runs in two contexts:

1. **Mode A (bundle-first):** After `bundle-validator` produces canonicalized file paths, run against the actual project output files to confirm they were written correctly.
2. **Mode B (brief-first):** After `token-expander` writes `docs/design-system-draft.md` and user approval is confirmed, run against the draft before final files are written.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `globals_css_path` | Yes | Path to `app/globals.css` or `src/app/globals.css` (or the draft CSS if pre-write check) |
| `tailwind_config_path` | Yes | Path to `tailwind.config.ts` |
| `design_system_md_path` | Yes | Path to `docs/design-system.md` or `docs/design-system-draft.md` |
| `token_checklist_path` | Yes | Path to `references/token-checklist.md` |
| `has_sidebar` | Yes | Boolean — whether the project has an app shell requiring sidebar tokens |

---

## Behavior

### Step 1 — Read All Input Files

Read `token_checklist_path` to internalize the complete list of required categories and their specific token names. Then read `globals_css_path`, `tailwind_config_path`, and `design_system_md_path` in full.

If any input file cannot be read, return `status: failed` immediately with a clear error identifying the missing file.

### Step 2 — Parse Token Definitions

From `globals_css_path`, extract:
- All CSS custom properties defined in `:root { }` — these are the light-mode tokens
- All CSS custom properties defined in `.dark { }` or `[data-theme="dark"] { }` — these are the dark-mode overrides
- Any CSS custom properties defined outside these blocks (note them as warnings — they may indicate misplaced tokens)

From `tailwind_config_path`, extract:
- All color bindings in `theme.extend.colors` — verify each references a CSS custom property (e.g., `hsl(var(--background))` or `oklch(var(--background))`) rather than a hardcoded value
- All `borderRadius`, `fontFamily`, `boxShadow` bindings — same verification

From `design_system_md_path`, extract:
- Documented decisions: color format, type scale approach, spacing decision, motion decision, breakpoint decision, z-index layer names, dark mode strategy
- Any TBD slots remaining (these are automatic failures)

### Step 3 — Run Category Checks

For each category in `token-checklist.md`, check the following. Record pass/fail and list specific missing token names for every failure.

**Surface Colors (required)**

- [ ] `--background` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--card` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--card-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--popover` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--popover-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`

**Brand Colors (required)**

- [ ] `--primary` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--primary-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`

- [ ] `--secondary-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--accent` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--accent-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`

**Semantic Colors (partial required)**

- [ ] `--destructive` in `:root` and `.dark` (required)
- [ ] `--destructive-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark` (required)
- [ ] Note which optional semantic tokens are present (success, warning, info pairs)

**Neutrals (required)**

- [ ] `--muted` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--muted-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--border` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--input` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--ring` in `:root` and `.dark`

**Charts (required — minimum 5)**

- [ ] `--chart-1` through `--chart-5` each in `:root` and `.dark`

**Sidebar (required only if `has_sidebar` is true)**

- [ ] `--sidebar` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-primary` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-primary-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-accent` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-accent-foreground` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-border` in `:root` and `.dark`
- [ ] `--sidebar-ring` in `:root` and `.dark`

**Typography — Font Families (required)**

- [ ] `--font-sans` in `:root`
- [ ] `--font-serif` in `:root`
- [ ] `--font-mono` in `:root`

**Type Scale (required — at least one full approach)**

- [ ] `design-system.md` documents which type scale approach was chosen (Option A or Option B)
- [ ] The chosen approach's tokens are present (either in `:root` as CSS custom properties, or explicitly documented as delegating to Tailwind defaults)
- [ ] No TBD slots remain in the type scale section

**Weights/Leading/Tracking (required)**

- [ ] `design-system.md` documents the weight scale (at minimum: regular 400, medium 500, semibold 600, bold 700)
- [ ] `design-system.md` documents the leading scale (at minimum: tight, normal, relaxed)
- [ ] `design-system.md` documents the tracking scale (at minimum: tight, normal, wide)

**Radius (required)**

- [ ] `--radius` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-sm` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-md` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-lg` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-xl` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-pill` in `:root`
- [ ] `--radius-full` in `:root`

**Spacing (required — decision documented)**

- [ ] `design-system.md` contains a "Spacing Decision" note — either "Using Tailwind default" or a custom scale
- [ ] No TBD slots remain in the spacing section

**Shadows (required)**

- [ ] `--shadow-sm` in `:root`
- [ ] `--shadow-md` in `:root`
- [ ] `--shadow-lg` in `:root`
- [ ] `--shadow-xl` in `:root`
- [ ] `--shadow-2xl` in `:root`

**Motion (required — decision documented)**

- [ ] Either motion CSS custom properties present in `:root` (duration fast/normal/slow + easing curves), OR `design-system.md` documents that motion is defined via Tailwind theme extensions
- [ ] No TBD slots remain in the motion section

**Breakpoints (required — decision documented)**

- [ ] `design-system.md` documents breakpoints — either "Using Tailwind defaults" or a custom scale with named values
- [ ] No TBD slots remain in the breakpoints section

**Z-index (required — named layers documented)**

- [ ] `design-system.md` contains a z-index layer table with named layers (not arbitrary numbers)
- [ ] No TBD slots remain in the z-index section

**Dark Mode (required — complete parity)**

- [ ] Every color token in `:root` has a corresponding entry in `.dark` (or `[data-theme="dark"]`)
- [ ] `design-system.md` documents the dark mode strategy (class-based, attribute-based, or system media query)
- [ ] `tailwind.config.ts` `darkMode` setting matches the documented strategy

### Step 4 — Tailwind Config Sanity Check

- [ ] Every color token in `:root` that is required by the checklist is bound in `tailwind.config.ts`
- [ ] All color bindings use a CSS variable reference — no hardcoded hex or HSL values in the config
- [ ] `darkMode` is set and matches the strategy in `design-system.md`
- [ ] `fontFamily.sans`, `fontFamily.serif`, `fontFamily.mono` are bound to the CSS custom properties
- [ ] `borderRadius` entries reference CSS custom properties
- [ ] `boxShadow` entries reference CSS custom properties

## Gate Rule

This agent returns `status: pass` in the return contract only when ALL of the following are true:

1. Every required category above shows PASS
2. Every conditional category (sidebar) shows PASS or N/A
3. Every color token has both a light and dark variant
4. No TBD slots remain in `design-system.md`
5. The type scale, spacing, motion, breakpoint, and z-index decisions are all documented
6. The Tailwind config sanity check passes

Any single failure → `status: fail`. The orchestrating skill uses the failure details to route corrective action (prompt user in Mode A, re-dispatch token-expander for missing categories in Mode B).

---

## Sub-Agent Return Contract

```yaml
status: complete | failed | needs_human
summary: <one paragraph — overall gate result, how many categories passed, what specifically failed, any warnings>
artifacts: []
needs_human: false | true
hitl_category: null | "prd_ambiguity" | "external_credentials" | "destructive_operation" | "creative_direction"
hitl_question: null | "<plain-language question if needs_human is true>"
hitl_context: null | "<what triggered this>"
```

**HITL triggers for this agent:**

- An input file cannot be found or read → `status: failed`, `needs_human: true`, `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`, `hitl_question: "I can't find [file]. Can you confirm the correct path?"`
- Gate fails → `status: failed`, `needs_human: false` (the orchestrating skill handles the corrective routing; this agent does not escalate a token gap as a human issue)

This agent does NOT call `ask_user_input_v0` directly. Human escalation is always bubbled up through the return contract.
