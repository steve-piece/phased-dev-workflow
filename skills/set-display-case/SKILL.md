# Set the Display Case: Design System Foundation

Validate or generate a complete design system before any feature work. Outputs canonical token files, writes design-system rules into the project rules file, and scaffolds the operator-only `/library` preview route.

This is a **daily-prep skill**, part of the run-once foundation phase that runs before any feature delivery. Also fully invocable standalone (no master checklist required) to bolt a design system onto any project. Mode is auto-detected from disk state.

---

## Mode detection

This skill runs in one of two modes, auto-detected at startup:

- **Standalone**: no `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` at the project root. Bolts a design system onto any project. Runs end-to-end, produces token files + Tailwind config + `/library` route, exits. No checklist coordination, no Prep-checkbox flip.
- **Sequential**: master checklist exists with a `## Prep` section. On completion, flip the `[ ] Display case built` row to `[x]` and surface: *"Display case ready. Next prep step: `/final-quality-check`."*

Honor an explicit `--standalone` or `--sequential` flag if passed; otherwise auto-detect from disk state.

## Project Config (optional)

Honor these `bytheslice.config.json` keys when present (see [`skills/setup-shop/references/bytheslice-config-schema.md`](../../setup-shop/references/bytheslice-config-schema.md)):

- `mcps.shadcn`, `mcps.figma`, `mcps.magic`, declarative MCP availability for the bundle-validator and token-expander agents
- `modelTiers.tokenExpander`, `modelTiers.bundleValidator`, `modelTiers.compliancePreCheck`, override agent model tiers for THIS run

---

## Two Input Modes

### Mode A: Bundle-First (preferred)

The user has run a Claude Design session at `claude.ai/design` and provides a design bundle folder. Reference example: `https://github.com/steve-piece/Modern-Refactor-Design-System`.

**Detection:** Look for one of these indicators:
- A folder path the user provides containing CSS variables, a Tailwind config, or a design token JSON
- A GitHub URL pointing to a design system export
- Explicit statement that a Claude Design session was completed

**Flow:**
1. Read the bundle folder (dispatch `agents/bundle-validator.md`)
2. Validate token completeness (dispatch `agents/compliance-pre-check.md`)
3. If gaps found: report missing categories → prompt user to fill them via `ask_user_input_v0`
4. Canonicalize file paths and write output artifacts
5. Capture project-specific code patterns (Step 4 below)
6. Append rules block to project rules file
7. Copy bundle into `docs/design-bundle/` as audit trail

### Mode B: Brief-First (fallback)

No bundle provided. Skill generates the token system from a brand brief.

**Detection:** No bundle folder, no design export, only a brand description, colors, or a quick brief.

**Flow:**
1. Collect brand brief from user if not already in context (via `ask_user_input_v0`)
2. Dispatch `bytheslice:token-expander` (opus, high effort, enforced by registration) to generate a complete token system
3. Surface the generated token system to the user for approval via `ask_user_input_v0`
4. If user requests changes: apply them and re-surface (cap at 2 rounds; third round → HITL `creative_direction`)
5. Dispatch `bytheslice:compliance-pre-check` to verify completeness on the approved tokens
6. Write output artifacts from approved token set
7. Capture project-specific code patterns (Step 4 below)
8. Append rules block to project rules file

---

## Step 1: Detect Mode and Gather Inputs

Determine which mode applies from context. If ambiguous, ask:

> "Do you have a Claude Design export or existing design bundle to validate? Or should I generate the token system from a brand brief?"

Collect:
- **Bundle path** (Mode A) OR **brand brief** (Mode B), required
- **Project rules file path**: CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md (from `cook-pizzas` Q12, or ask)
- **Detected stack and CSS entry path**: run the detection algorithm from [`../setup-shop/references/framework-detect.md`](../setup-shop/references/framework-detect.md). The CSS entry path varies by stack: `app/globals.css` (next-app), `styles/globals.css` (next-pages), `src/index.css` (vite-react), `src/app.css` (sveltekit), `src/styles/global.css` (astro). If detection returns `unknown`, ask the user.
- **App shell?**: does the project include a sidebar/nav shell? (determines whether sidebar tokens are required)

---

## Step 2: Token Validation Gate

Dispatch `bytheslice:compliance-pre-check` after collecting or generating tokens.

The gate **refuses to complete** until every required token category from `references/token-checklist.md` is satisfied. No partial passes.

If any category is missing:
- Report which categories are absent with their required token names
- In Mode A: prompt the user to provide the missing values
- In Mode B: loop `token-expander` for the missing categories (counts toward the 2-round cap)

Do not proceed to artifact writing until `compliance-pre-check` returns `status: pass`.

---

## Step 3: Write Output Artifacts

Once the gate passes, write these files in the target project:

| Artifact | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS token file | per detected stack (see [`framework-detect.md`](../setup-shop/references/framework-detect.md)) | `app/globals.css` (next-app) / `styles/globals.css` (next-pages) / `src/index.css` (vite-react) / `src/app.css` (sveltekit) / `src/styles/global.css` (astro) |
| Tailwind config | `tailwind.config.ts` | Token bindings; extends theme |
| Design system doc | `docs/design-system.md` | Canonical human-readable reference |
| Bundle audit trail | `docs/design-bundle/` | Mode A only, copy of the Claude Design export |

Use the templates in `references/` as the structural basis. Fill in project-specific values.

---

## Step 4: Capture Project-Specific Code Patterns

Prompt the user for these visual code patterns using `ask_user_input_v0`. Ask only if relevant to the project type (e.g., skip numeric column treatment for a marketing site). Present as `single_select` where possible.

**Always provide a recommended answer in available options.**

**Q-A, Variant library**
> "Which variant utility library will you use for component variants?"
> single_select: ["CVA (class-variance-authority)", "tv (tailwind-variants)", "None, plain className logic"]

**Q-B, Status indicator pattern**
> "How should status/state indicators look throughout the UI?"
> single_select: ["Soft pill badges", "Outlined badges", "Icon-only indicators", "None yet, decide per component"]

**Q-C, Numeric column treatment** (skip for marketing sites)
> "How should numbers in data tables be rendered?"
> single_select: ["tabular-nums (fixed-width, aligned)", "Proportional (default)", "No data tables in this project"]

**Q-D, Icon library**
> "Which icon library?"
> single_select: ["Lucide", "Phosphor", "Radix Icons", "Heroicons", "Custom / project-specific"]

**Q-E, Default text size for data-dense UI** (skip for marketing sites)
> "What default text size for data-dense views (tables, sidebars, forms)?"
> single_select: ["text-sm (14px)", "text-base (16px)", "No data-dense UI in this project"]

**Rules for code-pattern capture:**
- If the user answers "None yet", "No data tables", "No data-dense UI", or an equivalent non-answer: **omit that entry from the rules block entirely**. Do not invent defaults.
- Only the explicitly chosen patterns are written into the "Project-specific code patterns" subsection.

---

## Step 5: Append Rules Block to Project Rules File

Read `references/claude-md-rules-block.md` as the template. Fill in:
- Token catalog path: `docs/design-system.md`
- Project-specific code patterns from Step 4 (only the answered ones)

Append the completed block to the project rules file (CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md). Do not overwrite existing content, append only.

---

## Step 6: Scaffold the `/library` Preview Route

Dispatch [`agents/library-route-scaffolder.md`](agents/library-route-scaffolder.md). Pass:
- Project root path
- **Detected stack** (one of: `next-app`, `next-pages`, `vite-react`, `sveltekit`, `astro`, `unknown`), from [`framework-detect.md`](../setup-shop/references/framework-detect.md). The scaffolder uses this to pick the right route convention and theme primitive.
- Detected route-entry directory (per stack, `app/` for next-app, `pages/` for next-pages, `src/routes/` for sveltekit, etc.)
- `docs/design-system.md` path
- CSS entry path (per detected stack)
- Project rules file path
- Theme primitive already installed? (read from `package.json`, `next-themes` for Next, `mode-watcher` for SvelteKit, custom class-based for Vite + React, etc.)

The agent generates an operator-only Storybook-like preview route at `app/(dashboard)/library/` (or the detected route-group equivalent, falls back to `app/library/` if no route groups exist). The route uses **`?tab=<id>` query-param routing** over **one grouped registry**: `_registry/registry.tsx` holds `LIBRARY_GROUPS` (categories, each with `{ id, label, component }` entries), from which `LIBRARY` (alphabetical inside each folder) and `ALL_ENTRIES` derive. The page resolves `searchParams.tab` in three steps, legacy alias, exact id, pinned `DEFAULT_TAB`, so an unknown id falls back instead of throwing, and no type guard is needed. Each entry is **one file** under `_entries/<id>-entry.tsx` (no folder-per-entry), and **registering one is a single line in a single file**. There is deliberately no `LIBRARY_TABS` tuple, no `isLibraryTab()` guard, and no `STORIES` dispatch map: that triad only exists to police lockstep between registries that were split for no reason.

**Ids are the deep-link contract.** `DEFAULT_TAB` is pinned by id (never positional, since entries auto-sort), and retired ids go into `LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES` so previously copied review links keep resolving. Ids are never changed or reused.

The route renders:
- **Left sidebar as folders, not a flat list**: a logo header that links back to the app plus an `Operator-only, not in production nav` subtitle; a search input that force-opens every folder still holding a match; then collapsible category folders, each with a leading Lucide icon, an entry count, and a rotating chevron. The folder containing the active entry reads `text-primary` even when collapsed. Entry links nest under the folder with a left accent rail for the active one (no dot badges). Disclosure animates via CSS grid rows, honoring `motion-reduce`. Open-folder state is in-memory and seeded from the active tab, deliberately NOT persisted to `localStorage`, deep links are how operators arrive, and a stale restored open-set is noise.
- **A sticky reference toolbar** across the top of the main pane, rendered by the shell on every tab: a mono `/library?tab=<id>` chip on the left, and on the right two labeled copy pills, `Copy reference` (a markdown deep link to this exact preview) and `Copy link` (the raw URL). Shell ownership is what guarantees the affordance exists on every tab instead of depending on each entry author.
- **Main pane**: the selected entry. All of its variants and states live in that ONE tab, grouped into sections by concern, with contrasting states rendered side by side and the comparison named in the section title (`"States, default / disabled / loading"`). Page-sized blocks instead get labeled switcher axes over a fixed-height framed viewport. States, variants, and competing design directions never become their own tab.
- **Sidebar bottom rail**: a Sun/Moon theme toggle (`aria-label="Toggle theme"`), persisted across reloads. The theme is the one preference worth remembering.
- **Source-path copy buttons** next to every entry H1 and every section H3, click writes a Markdown link whose text is the file basename, e.g. `[button.tsx](components/ui/button.tsx:42-58)`, so when the operator pastes it into a Claude Code chat it renders as a clickable link scoped to the exact range they want changed. Line ranges are baked into the `sourcePath` string at the call site. The button is a one-file client island (`_components/entry-source-copy.tsx`) used by the server-renderable `<EntryHeader>` / `<EntrySection>` helpers in `_components/entry-frame.tsx`, which are **exported** so entry files import them rather than forking local clones.

The agent also **audits and excludes the route from every navigation surface**: app-sidebar, top-nav, mobile sheet, breadcrumbs, `app/sitemap.ts` (or `sitemap.xml`), `robots.txt` (or `app/robots.ts`), and any `<Link href="/library">` references in production code.

The route is seeded with one example entry, `buttons` (visited at `/library?tab=buttons`, the pinned default tab), rendering every variant from the design-system rules across every state, with sections per concern, contrasting states side by side, and the source-path affordance wired through. Subsequent components are added by `library-entry-writer` during `/sell-slice` Phase 4.5 (Library Preview Gate) as one line appended to the registry; every new or modified entry follows the same `EntryHeader sourcePath=… / EntrySection sourcePath=…` convention and the same one-tab-per-thing rule.

If the agent surfaces an HITL bubble (existing `/library` route, multiple parallel route groups, pages-router project, or stray internal links to `/library`), bubble it up via this skill's return contract. Do not silently overwrite production routes or guess at navigation conventions.

---

## Step 7: Return Contract

After all artifacts are written and the rules block is appended, return:

```yaml
status: complete | failed | needs_human
summary: <one paragraph, mode used, token categories validated, artifacts written, rules block appended>
artifacts:
  - <path to globals.css written>
  - <path to tailwind.config.ts written>
  - docs/design-system.md
  - docs/design-bundle/ (Mode A only)
  - <path to project rules file updated>
needs_human: false | true
hitl_category: null | "prd_ambiguity" | "external_credentials" | "destructive_operation" | "creative_direction"
hitl_question: null | "<plain-language question if blocked>"
hitl_context: null | "<what triggered this>"
```

**HITL triggers for this skill:**
- Token completeness cannot be resolved after 2 rounds (Mode B) → `creative_direction`
- User provides conflicting brand direction → `creative_direction`
- Bundle path does not exist or cannot be read → `needs_human: true`, `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`

This skill does NOT call `ask_user_input_v0` for HITL resolution, it bubbles up the structured contract and the orchestrator (or standalone skill at end-of-turn) prompts the user.

## Open Items / Known Limitations

- **The `/library` route is operator-only.** It is intentionally excluded from every navigation surface and from sitemap/robots. If multi-tenancy is added to the project later, gate the route behind a feature flag or a `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LIBRARY` env var to prevent end-tenant access. The route's `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` carry a top-of-file comment documenting this.
- **App Router only.** The library-route-scaffolder targets the Next.js App Router (`app/` or `src/app/`). Pages-router projects bubble HITL `prd_ambiguity` instead of generating a route.
