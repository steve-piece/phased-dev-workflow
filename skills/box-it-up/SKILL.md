<!-- Standalone closeout skill, re-scoped pie-level for v5 (spec §1.10). Pizza-shop framing: the pie cooled slice by slice — box it and hand it over. TWO call shapes: (1) per-slice, invoked repeatedly by /sell-pie's loop after each slice → commit + push only, no PR opened so CI does not fire; (2) pie-completion, invoked once when every slice in the active Pie is [x] → open one PR "Pie N", CI runs once, HITL review, merge PRESERVING per-slice commits (rebase/merge-commit, never squash), sync main --ff-only, delete branch, remove the pie worktree. Universal closeout safety preserved: a hand-rolled branch with no checklist still ships through the pie-completion path (no pie-status flip, project-default merge strategy). Decoupled from /sell-pie and /sell-slice so the operator can review / UAT before the boundary PR. -->

# /box-it-up

In v5 a **Pie** (a coherent chapter of 3–8 slices) is the unit of PR, CI, and review. `/box-it-up` carries both halves of the pie's git lifecycle:

- **Per slice** — `/sell-pie`'s loop calls `/box-it-up --slice` after each slice clears its gates. The skill commits the slice on the pie branch and pushes. **No PR is opened, so CI does not fire** — per-slice pushes stay cheap.
- **At the pie boundary** — when every slice in the active Pie is `[x]`, `/box-it-up` opens **one** PR `Pie N: <name>`, lets CI run **once**, gets your merge approval, merges **preserving every per-slice commit** (rebase or merge-commit, never squash), syncs `main` fast-forward-only, deletes the branch, and **removes the pie worktree**.

It is intentionally a **separate** skill so you can review the whole pie locally, run a manual visual UAT, or rebase against fresh main before deciding to ship the boundary PR. The closeout path is **universal** — safe to run on a hand-rolled branch that never touched the ByTheSlice delivery loop. Pre-flight checks and the merge/cleanup pattern do not assume a checklist or a pie.

---

## Mode detection

`/box-it-up` is **always standalone** and operates on whatever feature branch is currently checked out. It resolves one of three modes before doing anything:

| Mode | How it's detected | What it does |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| **per-slice** | Invoked with `--slice` (how `/sell-pie`'s loop calls it), or the operator explicitly asks to "box up the slice" mid-pie. | **Phase 1 only** — commit the slice on the pie branch + push. **No PR, no CI watch, no merge, no cleanup.** Returns immediately so the loop continues to the next slice. |
| **pie-completion** | Default. A master checklist exists, the current branch matches a `pie-<n>-<scope>` row, and **every** `### Slice N.M` under that `## Pie N` is `[x]`. Also the shape `/sell-pie` hands off at the boundary. | **Full closeout** — Phases 0 → 6: open one PR `Pie N`, CI once, HITL merge gate, merge preserving slice commits, sync main, delete branch, remove worktree, flip the pie's checklist status. |
| **universal** (hand-rolled) | No master checklist, or the branch doesn't map to a pie row. | **Same closeout as pie-completion** (Phases 0 → 6) minus the checklist-status flip, and merge strategy falls back to the project default. The universal-closeout safety net — never assumes ByTheSlice ran. |

**Refusal guards:**
- In **per-slice** mode, if the active Pie still has unfinished slices the skill must NOT try to open a PR — that is correct, expected mid-pie behavior, not an error.
- In **pie-completion** mode, if the master checklist shows the active Pie still has unchecked slices (`### Slice N.M` is `[ ]`), STOP and surface as `needs_human: true` with `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`: *"Pie N still has unfinished slices — finish them via /sell-pie before boxing the pie, or confirm you want to ship a partial pie."* Never silently ship an incomplete pie.

If a master checklist exists and the branch maps to a pie row, `/box-it-up` flips that **Pie's** status from `In Progress` to `Completed` after a successful merge (Phase 5). That is the only sequential-flavored behavior — best-effort enhancement, never a precondition.

## Subagent Roster

| Phase | Agent file | Model | Effort | Mode |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| 3 (on CI fail, pie-completion only) | [agents/ci-fix-attempter.md](agents/ci-fix-attempter.md) | sonnet | high | write |

CI watching itself is inline (`gh pr checks <pr> --watch` blocks until checks settle). No separate watcher subagent. **Per-slice mode dispatches no subagents** — there is no PR and therefore no CI to fix.

---

## Inputs and Preconditions

> Pre-enforced by `hooks/precheck-skill.sh` **when hooks are active** (BLOCK on main, WARN on missing gh auth). If `BTS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` or `disableAllHooks` is set, run the branch and `gh auth status` checks inline via tools and proceed silently. The preconditions are required either way; only the enforcement layer is optional. Never narrate the checks in chat.

- Working tree on a feature branch (not `main` / `master`) — for a v5 pie this is `pie-<n>-<scope>`.
- **Per-slice mode:** the slice's changes are committed locally OR present as uncommitted changes the skill should commit. `gh` is **not** required (no PR work).
- **Pie-completion / universal mode:** `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` returns "Logged in"); the repository has a remote (`git remote -v` returns at least `origin`).
- One **worktree per pie** — created upstream by `/sell-pie` when the pie branch is cut, removed here at the boundary. `/box-it-up` never *creates* a worktree; it only removes the pie's at completion.

---

## Workflow

> **Per-slice mode runs Phase 1 only, then returns.** Phases 0 and 2–6 are pie-completion / universal closeout. The phase numbering is shared so the per-slice commit logic is defined once.

### Phase 0 — Pre-flight Safety Checks *(pie-completion / universal)*

The skill refuses to proceed past Phase 0 if any check fails. The point is to avoid a destructive accident on `main` or an accidental push to a stale branch.

1. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — capture current branch as `BRANCH`.
2. **If `BRANCH` is `main` or `master`, STOP.** Surface as `needs_human: true` with `hitl_category: destructive_operation` and message: *"Refusing to ship from main. Switch to a pie / feature branch first."* Do not push, do not commit.
3. `git worktree list` — capture worktree state as `WORKTREE_PATH` (the path matching the current working directory) and `IS_WORKTREE` (`true` if cwd is not the main worktree). For a v5 pie this is the pie worktree slated for removal in Phase 5.
4. `gh pr list --state merged --limit 1 --base main --json headRefName,number,mergedAt` — capture the most recently merged PR. If `BRANCH` matches its `headRefName` (an already-shipped pie branch reused without renaming), STOP and surface as `needs_human: true` with `hitl_category: destructive_operation`. Ask whether to rename or proceed.
5. `gh pr list --state open --head "$BRANCH" --json number,url --jq '.[0]'` — check whether an open PR for this branch already exists. If yes, capture its number and URL as `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` / `EXISTING_PR_URL`. The skill reuses it (watch CI on the existing PR) rather than create a duplicate. Because per-slice pushes never open a PR, the first boundary run normally finds none.
6. `gh auth status` — confirm gh is authenticated. If not, surface as `external_credentials` HITL and stop.
7. **Pie-completeness check (pie-completion mode only):** confirm every `### Slice N.M` under the active `## Pie N` in `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md` is `[x]`. If any is `[ ]`, STOP per the Mode-detection refusal guard (`prd_ambiguity`).

### Phase 1 — Commit + Push *(both modes; the per-slice entry point)*

1. `git status --short` — if there are uncommitted changes, surface them and ask:
   - "Stage and commit these changes? (yes / let me write the message / cancel)"
   - **Always provide a recommended answer in the available options.** Default recommendation: yes if the diff looks like the in-scope slice; "let me write" if it includes unexpected files.
   - On `yes`: stage all changes and derive the commit message **by mode**:
     - **Per-slice mode** — use the v5 slice commit convention: **`feat(pie-N): N.M — <slice name>`** (swap `feat` for `fix`/`chore`/`docs` when the diff is purely a fix / infra-config / docs). One-line subject; short body listing touched files grouped by package/app. **If the slice touched UI** and `/sell-slice`/`/sell-pie` produced a closing-narrative paragraph (one paragraph: what was built · why this shape · what was left out · what reviewers should pay attention to), include it verbatim in the commit body before the file list. These per-slice commit messages are what the boundary PR preserves — they become the PR's commit-by-commit story, so keep each one self-describing.
     - **Pie-completion / universal mode** — only reached here when the boundary run finds straggler uncommitted changes (most slices are already committed by the per-slice runs). Derive a conventional type from the diff (`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:`/`docs:`) with a one-line subject and a file-list body.
   - On `let me write`: prompt for the message.
   - On `cancel`: stop here. Working tree unchanged.
2. `git push origin "$BRANCH"` — push to the pie branch. If the remote rejects (non-fast-forward, etc.), STOP and surface as `destructive_operation` HITL — never auto force-push.
3. **Per-slice mode ends here.** Return the per-slice contract (`status: complete`, the commit SHA + branch). **Do not open a PR, do not watch CI, do not merge.** The `/sell-pie` loop advances to the next slice; CI fires only at the pie boundary.

### Phase 2 — Open the Pie PR (or Reuse Existing) *(pie-completion / universal)*

1. **If `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` from Phase 0 is set**, skip to Phase 3 — the existing PR already tracks this branch.
2. **Otherwise**, open one PR for the whole pie:
   - **Title:** for a pie, `Pie N: <name>` (lift `N` and the name from the `## Pie N — <name>` checklist header). For a hand-rolled branch, fall back to `gh pr create --fill` (latest commit subject).
   - `gh pr create --base main --head "$BRANCH" --fill` — the `--fill` body lifts the accumulated slice commit subjects/bodies, so the per-slice closing-narrative paragraphs carry the design story into the PR description without a separate step. For a named pie, set the title explicitly (`--title "Pie N: <name>"`) and keep `--fill` for the body.
   - Capture the returned URL as `PR_URL` and the number as `PR_NUMBER`.
3. Output the PR URL to the user immediately so they can open it in a browser if they want to skim the pie.

### Phase 3 — Watch CI *(pie-completion / universal — CI's single run for the pie)*

This is the **one** time CI fires for the entire pie — per-slice pushes opened no PR. `gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --watch` blocks until every check finishes. Capture the exit code:

- **Exit 0** → all checks passed. Continue to Phase 4.
- **Non-zero** → at least one check failed. Capture the output (`gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER"`) and proceed to Phase 3a — the auto-fix loop.

The skill caps total CI watch time at **30 minutes per attempt**. If `--watch` does not return within 30 minutes (e.g. self-hosted runner hung), surface as `external_credentials` HITL.

#### Phase 3a — CI Fix Loop (on red)

Loop counter starts at 1. Cap at **3 attempts**.

1. Capture the failed-check rollup: `gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --json name,state,link,workflow`.
2. For each failed check, retrieve logs:
   - `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` for workflow runs, OR
   - `gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --comments` for non-Actions checks (e.g. external services posting back).
3. Dispatch `bytheslice:ci-fix-attempter` ([definition](agents/ci-fix-attempter.md); fallback on hosts without plugin agents: Read the file and pass its body as the prompt). Pass:
   - `PR_NUMBER`, `PR_URL`, `BRANCH`
   - The failed-check rollup
   - Truncated log excerpts (last 200 lines per failed job) — let the agent ask for more on demand
   - The pie diff (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`)
   - The attempt number
   - `previous_signature`: the signature the last attempt returned, or `null` on attempt 1
4. The agent stages + commits + pushes a targeted fix on the pie branch. Do not call `--watch` from inside the dispatch — the skill returns to Phase 3 (top) after the agent's commit lands and re-invokes `gh pr checks --watch` against the new head SHA.
5. Increment the counter. If it would exceed 3, STOP. Surface as `creative_direction` HITL with the full failure history so the user can decide whether to debug manually, retry CI, or close the PR.

The 3-attempt cap is a hard rule. Three identical-cause failures in a row signal a structural problem (flaky test, missing secret, infra outage) that needs human judgment.

**Bail on a repeated signature rather than counting to three.** The agent computes `signature = sha1(normalize(first_error_line) + '|' + file + '|' + check_id)`, where `normalize` strips line and column numbers, absolute path prefixes and timestamps, and returns it on every attempt. If it equals `previous_signature`, it patches nothing and returns `bail_reason: repeated_signature`: **stop the loop there** and surface the `creative_direction` HITL immediately, without burning the remaining attempts. A plain counter spends three full CI rounds on three identical failures exactly as it would on three different ones, and CI rounds are the most expensive loop in the plugin. This is the paragraph above made mechanical, by string equality rather than judgment.

### Phase 4 — Merge Authorization Gate *(pie-completion / universal — the kept pie-boundary HITL)*

CI is green. **Stop and prompt the user** (this is the §1.8 pie-boundary checkpoint — the one HITL the loop never auto-approves):

> "CI is green on PR `<PR_URL>` (Pie N). Approve merge?"
>
> Options (always include a recommended answer):
> 1. **Approve and merge now** (recommended if you've already reviewed the pie) — the skill merges **preserving every per-slice commit** (see strategy below) and proceeds to Phase 5.
> 2. **Hold — keep the PR open for manual review** — the skill exits, leaving the PR open. You merge via the GitHub UI when ready, then re-run `/box-it-up --resume` to do cleanup.
> 3. **Cancel — leave the PR open and stop** — the skill exits without merging.

**Merge strategy — preserve per-slice commits (never squash).** The whole point of the per-slice commits is that they survive the merge as the pie's history. These rules — merge preserving per-slice commits (never squash), `--ff-only` sync, `git worktree remove`/`prune` cleanup, and the boundary-PR body shape — come from [`../cook-pizzas/references/git-worktree-standard.md`](../cook-pizzas/references/git-worktree-standard.md) (Phase 3 + Invariants §5 + the PR template §6). Resolve the strategy in this order:

1. **Prefer rebase-merge** (`gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --rebase`) — replays each slice commit onto main, linear history, every `feat(pie-N): N.M` preserved.
2. If rebase is disallowed (`gh repo view --json rebaseMergeAllowed` is false), use a **merge commit** (`gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --merge`) — also preserves the individual commits under a merge node.
3. **Never `--squash`** for a pie — squashing collapses the per-slice commits into one and destroys the boundary contract. If a project's settings allow *only* squash (`squashMergeAllowed` true, both others false), STOP and surface as `needs_human: true` with `hitl_category: prd_ambiguity`: *"This repo only permits squash merges, which would collapse the pie's per-slice commits. Enable rebase or merge-commit merges, or confirm you accept a squash for this pie."* For a **hand-rolled** branch with no per-slice contract, the project default (including squash) is acceptable — the preserve-commits rule binds pies, not arbitrary branches.

Never force-merge a PR with non-required failing checks unless the user explicitly authorizes via the HITL prompt.

### Phase 5 — Post-merge Cleanup *(pie-completion / universal)*

Only runs after the PR is merged (by this skill in Phase 4 option 1, or by the user manually before `/box-it-up --resume`).

1. `gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json state` — confirm state is `MERGED`. If not, STOP. Don't pull or delete branches on a falsely-assumed merge.
2. `git checkout main` — if local uncommitted changes would be overwritten, STOP and surface as `destructive_operation` HITL. Never auto-stash.
3. `git pull --ff-only origin main` — fast-forward only. If this fails (history diverged), STOP and surface as `destructive_operation` HITL.
4. Confirm the PR's merge result is now in local main: `git log --oneline | grep -q "$PR_NUMBER\|<merge sha>"` (for a rebase-merge, confirm the slice commits landed). If absent, STOP and surface — something's odd.
5. **Flip the Pie's checklist status (pie-completion mode only):** in `docs/plans/00_master_checklist.md`, set the active `## Pie N` status from `In Progress` to `Completed`. Skip silently in universal mode (no checklist / no pie row).
6. `git branch -d "$BRANCH"` — delete local pie branch (safe delete; refuses if unmerged commits exist, which is what we want).
7. `git push origin --delete "$BRANCH"` — delete remote branch. If GitHub auto-deleted on merge, this returns "remote ref does not exist" — fine; record it but don't fail.
8. **Remove the pie worktree (if `IS_WORKTREE` from Phase 0 was true):**
   - `cd <main-worktree-path>` so we're not deleting our own cwd
   - `git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"` — remove the pie worktree directory
   - `git worktree prune` — clear stale metadata
9. `git status --short` — must be empty. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — must be `main`. `git status -uno` — confirm fully synced with remote. The pie is closed; the next pie starts in a fresh chat with a fresh worktree.

### Phase 6 — Final Report *(pie-completion / universal)*

Surface to the user:
- PR URL + merge commit SHA (+ note the merge strategy used: rebase / merge-commit)
- Pie name + branch name (now deleted) + worktree path (now removed)
- Per-slice commit count preserved on main
- Total CI attempts (1 if green on first run; up to 3 if the fix loop ran) + ci-fix-attempter dispatch count / per-attempt summary if applicable
- Final state: "On main, clean tree, fully synced with origin/main. Pie N closed — start the next pie in a fresh chat."

## HITL Handling

**Agents and this skill never call `ask_user_input_v0`.** At every elicitation point — the Phase 1 commit prompt and the Phase 4 merge-authorization gate — the skill **sets `needs_human: true` plus the `hitl_*` fields in its return contract** and lets the invoking orchestrator (`/sell-pie`'s loop, or the operator's session) surface the prompt. The phase descriptions above show the question text; the skill emits it as `hitl_question`, not as a direct tool call.

For sub-agent failures (e.g. `ci-fix-attempter` returns `needs_human: true`), the skill bubbles the structured fields up via its own return contract — it does not retry indefinitely.

HITL categories the skill produces:
- `destructive_operation` — about to push from main, force-push detected, merge-conflict pull, branch-reuse without rename, would-overwrite uncommitted changes on checkout.
- `external_credentials` — `gh` not authenticated, CI watch timeout (likely runner / secrets issue).
- `creative_direction` — ci-fix-attempter exhausted 3 attempts; user decides whether to debug, retry, or close the PR.
- `prd_ambiguity` — boxing a pie with unfinished slices; a squash-only repo that would collapse per-slice commits; a precondition that needs the user to tell the skill how to interpret state.

---

## Hard Constraints

- **Per-slice mode opens no PR and watches no CI.** Commit + push only, then return. CI fires exactly **once per pie**, at the boundary. Never open a PR mid-pie.
- **Preserve per-slice commits on a pie merge — never `--squash` a pie.** Rebase-merge by default, merge-commit as fallback. A squash-only repo is a `prd_ambiguity` HITL, not a silent squash.
- **One worktree per pie; `/box-it-up` only removes it.** The pie worktree is created upstream by `/sell-pie`. This skill removes it at the boundary (via `git worktree remove` + `prune`, never `rm -rf`) and never creates one. The merge/cleanup rules here are the standard's — see [`../cook-pizzas/references/git-worktree-standard.md`](../cook-pizzas/references/git-worktree-standard.md) (Phase 3 + Invariants §5).
- **Never ship from `main` / `master`.** Phase 0 step 2 is a stop-everything check.
- **Never force-push.** If `git push` is rejected for non-fast-forward, STOP. The user resolves on a fresh branch.
- **Never auto-merge a PR with failing required checks.** Phase 4 only runs when CI is green on the latest head SHA.
- **Never box an incomplete pie.** If any slice under the active Pie is still `[ ]`, STOP (`prd_ambiguity`).
- **Never `git stash` on the user's behalf.** If `git checkout main` would overwrite uncommitted changes, STOP.
- **Never auto-resolve merge conflicts during cleanup pull.** `--ff-only` fails fast; the user resolves.
- **Cap the CI fix loop at 3 attempts.** Beyond that → HITL `creative_direction`. No "one more try."
- **Cap CI watch at 30 minutes per attempt.** Beyond that → HITL `external_credentials`.
- **Reuse existing PRs.** If an open PR already tracks the branch, watch its CI; never create a duplicate.
- **Never call `ask_user_input_v0`.** Set `needs_human` + `hitl_*` and let the orchestrator prompt.
- **Subagent prompts live in `./agents/*.md`.** This SKILL.md is workflow only — never inline subagent prompts here.
- **Always provide a recommended answer in available options** at every elicitation point.

---

## Triggers

Follow this skill whenever the user (or `/sell-pie`'s loop):

- runs `/box-it-up` (pie-completion / universal closeout) or `/box-it-up --slice` (per-slice commit + push)
- says "box up the pie", "close out the pie", "ship the pr", "submit the pr", "open and merge the pr", "ship this branch", "ship this pie"
- has finished every slice of a Pie under `/sell-pie` and reached the pie boundary
- has a hand-rolled feature branch ready to ship (universal closeout)

If the working tree is on `main` with no feature branch in sight, redirect to `/sell-pie` (autonomous, whole pie) or `/sell-slice` (one careful slice) first.

If the user wants to open the boundary PR but pause before merging for code review, they should pick option 2 (Hold) at the Phase 4 gate.

---

## Completion Checklist

Walk the checklist that matches the mode. Do not report done until every applicable box is `[x]`.

### Per-slice mode

[ ] Current branch confirmed not `main` / `master` (it is the pie branch).
[ ] Slice committed with a `feat(pie-N): N.M — <name>` (or fix/chore/docs) message.
[ ] Branch pushed to `origin`.
[ ] No PR opened, no CI watched — returned cleanly so the loop continues.

### Pie-completion / universal mode

#### 1. Pre-flight passed

[ ] Current branch confirmed not `main` / `master`.
[ ] Worktree state captured (path + IS_WORKTREE flag).
[ ] No accidental reuse of a recently-merged branch.
[ ] `gh` authenticated.
[ ] (pie mode) Every slice under the active Pie is `[x]`.

#### 2. Pie PR open

[ ] Any straggler changes committed; branch pushed to `origin`.
[ ] One PR open against `main` — titled `Pie N: <name>` for a pie (or reused existing).
[ ] PR URL surfaced to the user.

#### 3. CI green on the merged head SHA

[ ] `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` returned exit 0 (CI's single run for the pie).
[ ] If the auto-fix loop ran, the final attempt cleared green; ci-fix-attempter dispatch history captured.
[ ] No required check skipped or pending.

#### 4. Merge authorized + completed (preserving slice commits)

[ ] Phase 4 user prompt surfaced (via `needs_human`/`hitl_*`) and answered.
[ ] Merge used rebase or merge-commit — **not** squash for a pie; per-slice commits preserved on main.
[ ] PR state is `MERGED` per `gh pr view`.

#### 5. Branch + worktree cleanup

[ ] On `main` locally.
[ ] `git pull --ff-only origin main` succeeded.
[ ] (pie mode) Pie status flipped `In Progress` → `Completed` in the master checklist.
[ ] Local pie branch deleted (`git branch -d`).
[ ] Remote pie branch deleted (or already auto-deleted by GitHub).
[ ] Pie worktree removed via `git worktree remove` and pruned via `git worktree prune` (if a worktree was used).
[ ] `git status --short` empty; `git status -uno` confirms fully synced with `origin/main`.

#### 6. Final report emitted

[ ] User received the report (PR URL, merge SHA + strategy, slice-commit count, attempt counts, "Pie N closed — next pie in a fresh chat").

---

## Sub-agent return contract

`/box-it-up` returns structured fields whether it ran per-slice or boxed the whole pie (e.g. when `/sell-pie`'s loop invokes it). It never prompts the user directly — the orchestrator reads `needs_human` + `hitl_*` and surfaces any question.

```yaml
status: complete | failed | needs_human
mode: slice | pie | universal
summary: <one paragraph — mode; for slice: commit sha + branch; for pie: pie name, PR URL + number, CI attempt count, merge strategy + SHA, per-slice-commit count preserved, cleanup state>
artifacts:
  - <commit sha (slice mode)>
  - <pr url (pie/universal mode)>
  - <merge commit sha (pie/universal mode)>
needs_human: false | true
hitl_category: null | "prd_ambiguity" | "external_credentials" | "destructive_operation" | "creative_direction"
hitl_question: null | "<plain-language question>"
hitl_context: null | "<what triggered this>"
```
